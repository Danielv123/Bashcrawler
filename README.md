# Bashcrawler
A text based adventure game written in batch with and unlimited world and autosaving.

You are Batch. Batch is a sturdy thing, but he doesen't exactly know what he is, who he is, where he is or anything really. Looking around him he finds himself with trees in every direction with the path to the north blocked for some strange reason, and the path to the east is blocked by an angry ant. What should he do, you may ask. How about typing "south"!

The adventures of Batch is an interesting story driven adventure game where you walk around, explore a vast growning world and try to dig up all those secret pieces of lore. You may also code your own tiles to the game, contributing to gameplay in the most important way there is.

#How to contribute

To write your own level, you need a few basic things.
1: Windows or some other OS allowing for execution of batch files (.bat)
2: A text editor (notepad)
3: A github profile for sending pull requests.

To actually make the level: 
Copy one of the existing ones. The name positions the tiles in the world, with 001001.bat as far as you can get to the northeast, 002001.bat 1 tile farther west and 002003.bat 2 tiles west and 3 tiles east. The character doesen't have to be able to walk in every direction, just make sure that Batch can walk from the start and into your tile in some way.
